# rustyweb npm package (shim)

This package is a wrapper that includes:
- `pkg/` — wasm artifacts (generated by wasm-pack)
- `native/` — native node bindings (.node + index.js)
- `bin/` — optional CLI binary for direct use

Before publishing, ensure `pkg/`, `native/`, and `bin/` are populated by CI or local builds.
